          Osaka has a large number of wholesalers and retail shops: 25,228 and
          34,707 respectively in 2004, according to the city statistics.[81]
          Many of them are concentrated in the wards of Chuō (10,468 shops) and
          Kita (6,335 shops). Types of shops vary from malls to conventional
          shōtengai shopping arcades, built both above- and underground.[82]
          Shōtengai are seen across Japan, and Osaka has the longest one in the
          country.[83] The Tenjinbashi-suji arcade stretches from the road
          approaching the Tenmangū shrine and continues for 2.6km (1.6 miles)
          going north to south. The stores along the arcade include commodities,
          clothing, and catering outlets. Other shopping areas include Den Den
          Town, the electronic and manga/anime district, which is comparable to
          Akihabara; the Umeda district, which has the Hankyu Sanbangai shopping
          mall and Yodobashi Camera, a huge electrical appliance store that
          offers a vast range of fashion stores, restaurants, and a Shonen Jump
          store. <br />
