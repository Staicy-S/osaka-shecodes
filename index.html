          <h3>Location</h3>
          <p class="location">
            Osaka has a large number of wholesalers and retail shops: 25,228 and
            34,707 respectively in 2004, according to the city statistics.[81]
            Many of them are concentrated in the wards of Chuō (10,468 shops)
            and Kita (6,335 shops). Types of shops vary from malls to
            conventional shōtengai shopping arcades, built both above- and
            underground.[82] Shōtengai are seen across Japan, and Osaka has the
            longest one in the country.[83] The Tenjinbashi-suji arcade
            stretches from the road approaching the Tenmangū shrine and
            continues for 2.6km (1.6 miles) going north to south. The stores
            along the arcade include commodities, clothing, and catering
            outlets. Other shopping areas include Den Den Town, the electronic
            and manga/anime district, which is comparable to Akihabara; the
            Umeda district, which has the Hankyu Sanbangai shopping mall and
            Yodobashi Camera, a huge electrical appliance store that offers a
            vast range of fashion stores, restaurants, and a Shonen Jump store.

            <h4>Osaka Castle</h4>
            <p>
              The castle is open to the public and is easily accessible from
              Osakajōkōen Station on the JR West Osaka Loop Line. It is a
              popular spot during festival seasons, and especially during the
              cherry blossom bloom (hanami), when the sprawling castle grounds
              are covered with food vendors and taiko drummers. The large indoor
              arena, Osaka-jō Hall, also is located within the grounds of the
              castle park. The central castle building is five stories on the
              outside and eight stories on the inside, and built atop a tall
              stone foundation to protect its occupants from attackers.

            <h4>Dotonburi</h4>
            <p>
              Dōtonbori or Dōtombori is one of the principal tourist
              destinations in Osaka, Japan, running along the Dōtonbori canal
              from Dōtonboribashi Bridge to Nipponbashi Bridge in the Namba
              district of the city's Chuo ward. Historically a theater district,
              it is now a popular nightlife and entertainment area characterized
              by its eccentric atmosphere and large illuminated signboards. One
              of the area's most prominent features, a billboard for
              confectionery company Glico displaying the image of a runner
              crossing a finishing line, is seen as an icon of Osaka within
              Japan.

            <h4>Pokemon Center</h4>
            <p>
              The Pokémon Center is a great place for fans to hang out. In
              Osaka, there is a Pokémon Center and it is very close to JR Osaka
              Station. In addition to Pokémon game software and card games, the
              shop also offers a wide range of original products from toys to
              stationery, t-shirts and snacks. It's so exciting for customers
              even from just looking around in the shop. There is also a Pokémon
              Card Station, where a variety of card events are held every day.
              It's only a 5-minute walk from JR Osaka Station to the shop.
              Please feel free to visit our shop when you come to Osaka.
